Validation Steps:

In order to validate the scaling functionality, Ubuntu cloud image was used to to bring up the Left VM and Right VM.(https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/)
These VM's do have two network interfaces; management and Left/Right interface.
 (management interface was needed to ssh onto the vm and as a reason of using management on eth0 a static route is added as shown)

Step 1. Download the image and use it in the env file after uploading it via glance:


 # VM config  
  flavor: 'm1.small'
  image: 'Ubuntu'  
  svm_name: 'PAN_SVM'
  left_vm_name: 'Left_VM'
  right_vm_name: 'Right_VM'
  server_key: server_key


Step2: Root the ubuntu 

root@node-8:~# 
root@node-8:~# ssh ubuntu@10.4.60.163 -i server_key.pem 
The authenticity of host '10.4.60.163 (10.4.60.163)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 72:ea:fa:23:60:25:0f:a9:40:a7:da:cd:32:84:45:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.4.60.163' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

ubuntu@left-vm:~$ sudo passwd root
sudo: unable to resolve host left-vm
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
ubuntu@left-vm:~$ 
ubuntu@left-vm:~$ 



Step3: add dhcp on eth1

root@left-vm:~$  ip link set dev eth1 down
root@left-vm:~$  dhclient eth1
  
  Edit the file : vi /etc/network/interfaces to add the below data:
  
  ## To configure a dynamic IP address
	auto eth1
	face eth1 inet dhcp
	
	For these settings to take effect you need to restart your networking services. : /etc/init.d/networking restart
	
	
	
Step4: Install iperf3

add-apt-repository "ppa:patrickdk/general-lucid"
apt-get update	
apt-get install iperf3


Once complete set up one fo the hosts to act as server and listen and the other as client to send out traffic. 
These are the below line used for CPU based scaling and throughput based scaling respectively:

server: iperf3 -s
client: iperf3 -c <server-ip> -P 10 -t 300 ---> (cpu_util)
client: iperf3 -c <server-ip> -u -b 100m -t 300 --> (network bit rate)
